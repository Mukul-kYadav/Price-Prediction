Price Prediction Project

This data science project contains code for real estate price prediction website. 
First, I built a model using sklearn and linear regression using banglore home prices dataset from [Kaggle](kaggle.com). 
Then write a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests.
Then component is the website built in html, css and javascript that allows user to enter home square ft area, bedrooms etc and it will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price.
During model building almost all data science concepts are covered such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation etc.

Technology and tools used:

1) Python

2) Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning

3) Matplotlib for data visualization 4) Sklearn for model building

5) Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE

6) Python flask for http server

7) HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI
